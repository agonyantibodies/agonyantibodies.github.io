<h3 class="h2">Gwen</h3>
I am the editor and founder of the blog. Currently, I’m a research assistant at the University College Cork where I’m 
investigating the role of phages (viruses that only infect bacteria) in the gut. I received a bachelor’s degree at 
University College Ghent (Belgium) in Medical Laboratory Sciences and an MSc in Immunology and Global Health from Maynooth 
University (Ireland). My interests are in parasitology, (emerging) infectious diseases and public health, all topics which I hope
to blog about.
