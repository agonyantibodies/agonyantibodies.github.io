I am the editor of the blog. Currently, I’m a research assistant at the APC Microbiome (University College Cork) where I’m 
investigating the role of phages (viruses that only infect bacteria) in the gut. I received a bachelor’s degree at 
University College Ghent (Belgium) in Medical Laboratory Sciences and an MSc in Immunology and Global Health from Maynooth 
University (Ireland). My interests are in parasitology, (emerging) infectious diseases and public health, all topics which I hope
to blog about.

<h3 class="h2">Margo Henkhaus</h3> 
I am currently working as an Environmental Health Specialist for Maricopa County where I help local businesses to comply 
with FDA regulations and ensure preventative public health measures are met. I received my undergraduate degree from Arizona 
State University (USA), where I double majored in Biochemistry and Global Health; I received my Masters in Immunology and 
Global Health from Maynooth University (Ireland). My interests are in epidemiology and public health, with particular focus on 
how socioeconomic status affects the distribution of disease within a population.
