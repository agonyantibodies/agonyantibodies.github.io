Dear reader,

Welcome to our blog!
The Agony Antibodies are a collaborative of friends with a passion for all things immunology. We are a collective of people engaged with science communication and immunology/vaccinology. Most of us have graduated from Maynooth University (Ireland) with an MSc in Immunology and Global Health. You can find more information about our members <a href='{{"http://agonyantibodies.github.io/people/"}}'>here</a>.

The group is very passionate about immunology, global health and vaccinology, and we would like to address some of the questions we often see appear on these topics. A lot of information that can be found online is confusing and sometimes counter-intuitive. This blog was therefore created to address these subjects and hopefully help clear up some of the information and disinformation. 

We are delighted to have you on our blog and hope you have a wonderful experience here.
